Worked on this project with Aya Adel, Youssef Khafaga, Martina Mamdouh, Theodora George and Mariette Magdi.

Our project is an e-commerce website using Laravel Framework. The
website aims to help people buy anything from home. We can have
more than one vendor and the costumer can buy from any of their
products
